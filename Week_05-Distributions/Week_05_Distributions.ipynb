        "* Considered grandfather of statistics\n",
        "* Popularized regression to the mean\n",
        "* English Victorian era polymath: a statistician, sociologist, psychologist, anthropologist, tropical explorer, geographer, inventor, meteorologist, proto-geneticist, psychometrician and a proponent of social Darwinism, eugenics, and scientific racism. He was knighted in 1909.\n",
        "* He was Charles Darwin's half-cousin, sharing the common grandparent Erasmus Darwin. His father was Samuel Tertius Galton, son of Samuel Galton, Jr. He was also a cousin of Douglas Strutt Galton. The Galtons were Quaker gun-manufacturers and bankers, while the Darwins were involved in medicine and science.\n",
        "* Galton was interested at first in the question of whether human ability was hereditary, and proposed to count the number of the relatives of various degrees of eminent men. If the qualities were hereditary, he reasoned, there should be more eminent men among the relatives than among the general population.\n",
        "* On Friday 19 February 1877 Galton gave a lecture entitled Typical Laws of Heredity at the Royal Institution in London. In this lecture, he posited that there must be a counteracting force to maintain population stability. His showpiece for the night was the Galton board.\n",
        "* Galton invented the term eugenics ...  believed that a scheme of 'marks' for family merit should be defined, and early marriage between families of high rank be encouraged via provision of monetary incentives. He pointed out some of the tendencies in British society, such as the late marriages of eminent people, and the paucity of their children, which he thought were dysgenic. He advocated encouraging eugenic marriages by supplying able couples with incentives to have children. On 29 October 1901, Galton chose to address eugenic issues when he delivered the second Huxley lecture at the Royal Anthropological Institute.\n",
        "* According to the Encyclopedia of Genocide, Galton bordered on the justification of genocide when he stated: \"There exists a sentiment, for the most part quite unreasonable, against the gradual extinction of an inferior race.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Galton Board and the Bell Curve\n",
        "\n",
        "* The path of any individual ball is like a sequence of independent coin flips\n",
        "* The ball can go left or right at each pin\n",
        "* It seems random but with a large sample a probability distribution appears, a normal distribution\n",
        "* Galton noted the same shape when comparing the height of 1000 French military recruits\n",
        "* Galton board was a model for the inheritance of stature and many other genetic traits\n",
        "* The balls inherit their position the same way humans inherit their stature\n",
        "* One way to illustrate a problem with this is by doubling the width of the Galton board base thus increasing the number of rows and pegs and increasing the variance of the distribution\n",
        "* Galton wanted to prove superior intellect through breeding without taking into account privilege\n",
        "* The idea of superior, again, is defined by the culture and not universal\n",
        "* Galton thought he had discovered a law of heredity instead of statistics, the regression of the mean\n",
        "* Thought regression toward the mean was nature's way of keeping things the same from generation to generation\n",
        "* This was thought of as causal but soon abandoned this idea in favor of correlation\n",
        "* Did a lot of father-son pair height testing\n",
        "* Predictions for heights seemed to fall on a line, the line of regression\n",
        "* Soon causation became highly frowned upon; thought to not exist; there are only relationships, association, correlation. More on this next week when we introduce (C)Karl Pearson\n",

To test this specification, the engineer tests 20 randomly-selected products each day. If more than 3 of them fail to meet quality standards, then production is halted while the entire day’s production must be tested. If the factory is not meeting specifications and only 70% of its produced products are meeting quality standards, what is the probability that the quality control engineer will fail to notice this problem in her daily test?\n",
